    "text": "Shipping problem\nThe intuition behind the Kantorovich problem can be given by an explanation of optimizing shipments. Suppose there is a merchant who is attempting to ship items from one place to another. The merchant can hire trucks at some cost \\(c(x, y)\\) for each unit of merchandise which is shipped from point \\(x\\) to point \\(y\\). Now the shipper is approached by a mathematician, who claims that prices can be set such that they align with the shipper’s financial interests (Carlier 2010). This would be achieved by setting the price \\(\\phi(x)\\) and \\(\\phi(y)\\) such that the sum of \\(\\phi(x)\\) and \\(\\phi(y)\\) is always less than the cost \\(c(x, y)\\). This may even involve setting negative prices in certain cases. However, it can be shown that the shipper will spend almost as much as they would have if instead they opted for the original pricing method (Paris 2016)."

    "text": "Transport Plans\nThe Monge problem was about the optimal way to rearrange mass (Craig 2020). Note that in the Monge formulation of the optimal transport problem, the mass cannot be split and thus it is mapped \\(x \\mapsto T(x)\\). When considering discrete cases, this results in problems when trying to establish maps T such that \\(T_{\\#} \\mu=\\nu\\). Kantorovich made the observation that the mass in question could be split, which makes the problem much easier to model  Craig, Katy. The Kantorovich Problem. Math 260L. Univ. of Ca. at Santa Barbara. Spring 2020 . Allowing the mass to be split results in a relaxation of the problem (e.g. half of the mass from \\(x_1\\) can go to \\(y_1\\) and half can go to \\(y_2\\), and so on). To model this consider \\(d \\pi(x, y)\\), which denotes the mass transported from x to y. This allows the mass to be moved to multiple places. Also consider \\(\\mu(A)\\) and \\(\\nu(B)\\): where the total mass taken from measurable set \\(A \\in X\\) must be equal to \\(\\mu(A)\\) and the total mass taken from measurable set \\(B \\in Y\\) must equal \\(\\nu(B)\\).\nThe constraints of the problem can be written in the following manner:\n\\[\n\\pi(A \\times Y)=\\mu(A)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\pi(X \\times B)=\\nu(B)\n\\]\nfor all measurable sets \\(A \\subseteq X, B \\subseteq Y\\). As such, we can interpret \\(\\pi( A\\times B)\\) as representing the amount of mass from \\(\\mu (A)\\) that is directed to \\(\\nu (B)\\)\nIf we have a measure \\(\\pi\\) that satisfies these constraints, then the set of such \\(\\pi\\) is referred to as \\(\\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)\\) – the set of transport plans between \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu\\). Notice again that now we are dealing with transport plans instead of the transport maps that are used in the Monge formulation of the problem  Craig, Katy. The Kantorovich Problem. Math 260L. Univ. of Ca. at Santa Barbara. Spring 2020 ."

More specifically, if one turns to the narrow topology, then it turns out that we get compactness of the constraint set. Moreover, such a topology ensures us that our objective function is lower semi-continuous."
